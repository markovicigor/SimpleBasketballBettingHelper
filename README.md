# SimpleBasketballBettingHelper

A simple betting application for basketball games. This app uses two external apis, one for obtaining data about current matches, 
and the other one for obtaining data from the betting shop (odds and point limits). 
The application compares the average number of points scored by the home team and the visiting team and compares it with the point limits from the betting shop.
Based on that, app calculate chance for under points or over points for each game.
